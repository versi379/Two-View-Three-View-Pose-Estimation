% Description:
% This function estimates the pose of three views based on corresponding
% triplets of points, using optimized fundamental matrix estimation.
% The fundamental matrices are initialized by the linear solution and
% refined by a Gauss-Helmert minimization of the standard error for
% two of the three possible pairs of views. The essential matrices are
% computed using the calibration matrices. The orientations are extracted by SVD.
%
% Input:
% matchingPoints: 6xN matrix, containing in each column the 3 projections of
%                 the same space point onto the 3 images
% calMatrices: 9x3 matrix containing the 3x3 calibration matrices for
%              each camera concatenated
%
% Output:
% R_t_2: 3x4 matrix containing the rotation matrix and translation
%        vector [R2,t2] for the second camera
% R_t_3: 3x4 matrix containing the rotation matrix and translation
%        vector [R3,t3] for the third camera
% Rec: 3xN matrix containing the 3D reconstruction of the
%      correspondences
% iter: number of iterations needed in GH algorithm to reach minimum
